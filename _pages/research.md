# Each entry in `sections:` can use the knobs below:
#   title       → visible heading text
#   id          → anchor slug and marker used in <!-- section: id -->
#   collection  → which Jekyll collection to pull items from (portfolio, publications, news, etc.)
#   filter      → optional boolean flag to include items where that front-matter key is true (e.g., featured)
#   slugs       → optional ordered list of specific items to show instead of the whole collection
#   sort        → field used for ordering (defaults to date)
#   order       → "asc" for ascending; omit for descending
#   limit       → maximum number of items to display
#   style       → card layout name (currently "projects" or "publications")
#   show_meta   → set to false to hide project metadata line
#   cta_url / cta_label → optional button under publication lists
#   link_field  → front-matter field to use for the 🔗 icon (set to "url" to use the page URL)
#   link_url    → constant URL applied to every item (overrides link_field if present)
#   link_external → true to open the icon link in a new tab
#   link_label_prefix → optional text prepended to the accessible label for the icon
# Any Markdown between <!-- section: id --> and <!-- endsection --> renders inside the card before the auto-generated list.
