Erick designs *microfabricated and microfluidic platforms* that couple brain organoids with high fidelity electrophysiology for stable, long duration recordings. Systems maintain controlled perfusion, stabilize shear and oxygenation, and yield reproducible multichannel readouts with documented analysis. Current work focuses on a three well millifluidic platform with stretchable multi electrode arrays that supports *parallel experiments, standardized flow profiles, and cross comparability*.

Core strengths include fabrication of stretchable MEAs on polyimide with PEDOT:PSS impedance lowering, reliable PDMS micro and millifluidics with plasma bonding and inline bubble removal, and low noise acquisition supported by custom MATLAB code analysis for spike detection, quality checks, and general signal processing. Designs follow COMSOL flow and mass transport modeling.The emphasis is on reproducibility and modeling for the advancement of disease models based on organoids.

Born and raised in Quito, Ecuador, he moved to South Korea for university and earned an engineering degree in Electrical Engineering from *Korea University* in 2022 as a recipient of the Korean Government Scholarship Program (KGSP), now called the **Global Korea Scholarship (GKS)**. He completed a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering at the *Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)* in 2025 under the supervision of Professor Hyunjoo Jenny Lee, where he developed a micro/millifluidic platform integrated with electrophysiology for integrated analysis.

Erick is a **PhD student at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU)** and a member of the **Intelli-Ingest consortium**, a **Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions Doctoral Network** funded by the European Union through Horizon Europe. His current work focuses on the design, fabrication and formulation of micromotors, nanoparticles, and needles, that can be incorporated into devices for targeted drug release, better penetration to the intestinal mucosa, and increased exposure of the formulation to the epithelium for integration with ingestible capsules. The network brings together researchers across Europe and advances minimally invasive oral devices for diagnostics and therapy.
