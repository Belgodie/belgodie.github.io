Erick is a **PhD candidate at the Technical University of Denmark** and a member of the **Intelli-Ingest consortium**, a **Marie Sklodowska Curie Doctoral Network** funded by the European Union through Horizon Europe. His current work focuses on the design and manufacture of API loaded microparticles and microneedles for oral delivery, including formulation selection, in vitro release profiling, and integration into ingestible capsules. The network brings together researchers across Europe and advances minimally invasive oral devices for diagnostics and therapy.

Born in Quito, Ecuador, Erick earned an engineering degree in Electrical Engineering from Korea University in 2018 as a recipient of the Korean Government Scholarship Program, now called the Global Korea Scholarship. He completed a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in 2025 under Professor Hyunjoo Jenny Lee, where he developed a microfluidic platform that improves organoid maturation and enables integrated analysis.
