Erick is a PhD Candidate at the Technical University of Denmark, where he conducts interdisciplinary research as part of the INTELLI-INGEST Doctoral Network for the development of minimally invasive, orally delivered miniaturized devices, aligned with the goals of the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Doctoral Networks. He collaborates with 13 researchers to locate ingestible devices inside the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and enable them to interact with tissues using new actuation systems. 

Born and raised in Quito, Ecuador, Erick earned his Engineering Degree in Electrical Engineering from Korea University in 2018 awarded the prestigious Korean Government Scholarship Program (now known as the Global Korea Scholarship). He then obtained a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2025, under the mentorship of Prof. Hyunjoo Jenny Lee, which had him work on the development of a microfluidic platform for enhanced organoid development and analysis.
